## Yesterday

"Yesterday" is a song originally recorded by the  Beatles for their 1965 album Help!. Although credited to "Lennonâ€“McCartney", the song was written solely by Paul McCartney. It remains popular today with more than 2,200 cover versions,[3] and is one of the most covered songs in the history of recorded music.[note 1] At the time of its first appearance the song was released by the Beatles' record company as a single in the United States but not in the United Kingdom (for further details see below). Consequently, whilst it topped the American chart in 1965 the song first hit the British top 10 three months after the release of Help! in a cover version by Matt Monro. "Yesterday" was voted the best song of the 20th century in a 1999 BBC Radio 2 poll of music experts and listeners and was also voted the No. 1 Pop song of all time by MTV and Rolling Stone magazine the following year. In 1997, the song was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. Broadcast Music Incorporated (BMI) asserts that it was performed over seven million times in the 20th century alone.
